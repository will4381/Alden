## Advanced Premium Arbitrage Strategy

This strategy is designed to optimize premium selling in options trading by using risk management formulas, technical indicators, and machine learning predictions.

---

### Position Sizing:

The number of contracts to sell is calculated as:

```
Contracts = max(1, min((Adjusted Risk) / (Option Price × 100), 30))
```

Where:

```
Adjusted Risk = Base Risk × Volatility Factor
```

```
Base Risk = Capital × Base Risk Per Trade
```

```
Volatility Factor = clip(Volatility / 40, 0.7, 2.5)
```

---

### Option Price Simulation:

The option price is estimated using the following:

```
Option Price = Implied Volatility × Close Price × 0.1
```

Where:

```
Implied Volatility = sqrt(252) × StdDev(Returns over 30 days)
```

---

### Exit Criteria:

To determine when to exit a position:

```
Profit Percentage = (Entry Price - Current Price) / Entry Price
```

```
Exit Condition =
  True, if Profit Percentage >= Profit Target
  True, if Profit Percentage <= Stop Loss
  True, if Time Held > 45 minutes
  False, otherwise
```

---

### Bollinger Bands and Z-Score:

```
Bollinger Upper = Rolling Mean + 2 × Rolling StdDev
```

```
Bollinger Lower = Rolling Mean - 2 × Rolling StdDev
```

```
Z-Score = (Close Price - Rolling Mean) / Rolling StdDev
```

---

### ML Model Features:

Features used for machine learning predictions:

```
Returns = (Close Price_t - Close Price_t-1) / Close Price_t-1
```

```
Z-Score = (Close Price - Rolling Mean) / Rolling StdDev
```

```
Bollinger Bandwidth = Bollinger Upper - Bollinger Lower
```

### Notes:

- Parameters like `Profit Target`, `Stop Loss`, and `Base Risk Per Trade` are user-adjustable.
- Use these equations as the foundation for implementation, while adapting thresholds and conditions to specific trading strategies.
